### Sources of anxiety
Financial stress
Dealing with school interpersonal relationships with students, parents, and her teacher friends and 4th grade team
MIL recently diagnosed with breast cancer for 2nd time 
Generally keeping up with all the work that needs to be done, both professionally and domestically at home because of agreeing to take on too much. 
Struggles to maintain positive self-image. Especially regarding her physical looks. Has gained some weight (probably due to beginning SSRIs for anxiety) and has a very hard time with it. We are working to help her lose some of the weight, and have had some success so far, but progress is slow. 
Would like to start a family soon
